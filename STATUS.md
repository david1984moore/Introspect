  - Added session persistence (localStorage, 7-day retention, 500ms debounce)
  - Built conditional logic system for adaptive questioning

- ✅ **Cost Calculator Foundation**: Real-time calculation engine
  - Comprehensive COST_CONFIG with feature costs, platform multipliers
  - calculateProjectCost function with complexity analysis
  - Platform multipliers (iOS/Android 1.5x, Desktop 1.3x, PWA 1.1x)
  - Integration costs for payment, CRM, marketing tools
  - Complexity multipliers based on feature selection

- ✅ **Landing Page & Navigation**: Complete user experience flow
  - Professional landing page with key benefits
  - Resume functionality for saved sessions
  - Completion page with project estimate display

- **Cost Calculation**: Client-side real-time calculation (<50ms target)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first Tailwind CSS with utility classes
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Performance**: Optimized for <1.5s FCP, <100ms interaction response

**Key Features Working:**
- ✅ Session auto-save and resume functionality
- ✅ Real-time cost calculation foundation
- ✅ Adaptive questioning logic framework
- ✅ Mobile-responsive landing page
- ✅ Professional design system (primary blue palette)
- ✅ Accessibility-ready focus states and semantic HTML

**Latest Updates:**

- ✅ **Question Container Component**: Reusable wrapper for all 18 questions
  - Sticky header with cost display
  - Back/Continue navigation buttons
  - Progress dots (simplified, no counts)
  - Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

```

### State Management Architecture
- **QuestionnaireState**: 18-question responses + cost calculation + conditional logic
- **Actions**: START, NEXT/PREVIOUS, UPDATE_RESPONSE, CALCULATE_COST, SAVE/LOAD_SESSION
- **Auto-save**: Debounced localStorage writes every 500ms
- **Session Recovery**: 7-day retention with automatic expiration cleanup

### Cost Calculation System
- **Base Costs**: $1,000-$8,000 per feature based on complexity
- **Platform Multipliers**: Web 1.0x, iOS/Android 1.5x, Desktop 1.3x
- **Complexity Multipliers**: Simple 1.0x, Moderate 1.3x, Complex 1.8x
- **Integration Costs**: $800-$3,000 per integration
- **Real-time Updates**: <50ms calculation performance target

---

## Notes & Decisions
- Using Next.js 14 App Router (not Pages Router) for modern architecture
- Client-side cost calculation for <50ms performance (vs server-side)
- localStorage persistence (vs cookies) for 7-day retention without server dependency
- React Context + useReducer (vs external state library) per scope requirements
- Mobile-first Tailwind approach with responsive utilities
- Professional blue color palette following Jobs/Ives design principles
