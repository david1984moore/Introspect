## Notes & Decisions
- Used basic React state management instead of React Hook Form for simplicity
- Target customers limited to 12 predefined options to reduce complexity
- Form validation implemented with inline error messages
- Progress bar shows completion percentage (83.3% after Section 5)
- **CRITICAL: useEffect infinite loops** - Fixed by wrapping ALL parent handler functions in useCallback
  - Issue: Handler functions recreated on every render → child useEffect runs infinitely
  - Solution: useCallback with empty deps for all handleSectionXChange functions
  - Applied to: All sections (1-5) in website/page.tsx
- /commit alias now includes automatic GitHub push for streamlined workflow
