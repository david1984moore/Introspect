# Project Scope: Client Requirements Gathering Tool

**Project Name:** Applicreations Requirements Wizard
**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025

---

## ‚úÖ IN SCOPE (What We're Building)

### Core Features

1. **Website Requirements Questionnaire** (Primary - MVP)
   - 6-section conversational form (20 minutes max completion time)
   - Smart branching logic (questions adapt based on previous answers)
   - Progress indicator and save/resume functionality
   - Mobile-responsive design (mobile-first approach)

2. **Application Requirements Questionnaire** (Secondary - Phase 2)
   - Alternative form option when starting new project
   - Similar structure to website version but app-focused questions

3. **AI Analysis Engine**
   - Processes client responses using Claude/GPT API
   - Generates tech stack recommendations with reasoning
   - Creates realistic timeline and budget estimates
   - Identifies potential risks and dependencies
   - Produces two versions of output (client-friendly + technical)

4. **Dual Report Generation**
   - **Client Version:** Plain English summary with next steps
   - **Technical Version:** Full SCOPE.md formatted for Cursor workflow
   - Both versions generated simultaneously from same data

5. **Email Delivery System**
   - Sends technical SCOPE.md to Applicreations email
   - Sends client version to client's email
   - Includes both as downloadable attachments

### Must-Have Requirements (MVP)

- Works perfectly on mobile devices (60%+ of small business owners use phones)
- Completion time under 20 minutes with all follow-ups
- No technical jargon in client-facing questions
- Visual, engaging UI (icons, progress bar, friendly copy)
- Save progress functionality (generates unique link to resume)
- Questions use checkboxes, radio buttons, and simple text fields (minimal typing)
- Conditional logic shows/hides questions based on selections
- All generated content is copy-paste ready (properly formatted markdown)
- Client version uses simple language, analogies, and clear expectations
- Technical version includes all details needed for Cursor workflow

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Non-technical user can complete website questionnaire in under 20 minutes
- [ ] AI generates accurate tech stack recommendation 90%+ of time
- [ ] Generated SCOPE.md requires minimal manual editing
- [ ] Client version is understandable to someone with zero tech knowledge
- [ ] Technical version contains all sections from Cursor workflow template

## ‚ùå OUT OF SCOPE (NOT Building in v1.0)

- ‚ùå **User authentication/login** - Not needed for v1.0, no repeat users expected
- ‚ùå **Admin dashboard** - Can view emails for now, build dashboard in v2.0
- ‚ùå **Payment processing** - This tool is free for clients, no payments
- ‚ùå **Digital signatures** - Just email approval for now, add e-signature later
- ‚ùå **Multi-language support** - English only for v1.0
- ‚ùå **Video tutorials** - Text instructions sufficient for launch
- ‚ùå **Client portal** - One-time form, no need for clients to log back in
- ‚ùå **Version control/revisions** - If client wants changes, they restart form
- ‚ùå **PDF generation** - Markdown output is sufficient, PDF is nice-to-have
- ‚ùå **Analytics dashboard** - Can add Google Analytics later
- ‚ùå **Template library** - Just website + app forms for now
- ‚ùå **White-label/licensing** - Build for Applicreations only first

## üÖøÔ∏è PARKING LOT (Great Ideas for v2.0)

1. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Why not now: Can manage via email for first 10-20 submissions
   - Revisit when: Processing 5+ forms per week
   - Would include: View all submissions, search, export to CSV

2. **Visual Example Gallery**
   - Why not now: Adds complexity to v1.0
   - Revisit when: Have collected 20+ example sites
   - Would include: Curated gallery of sites by style/industry

3. **PDF Export**
   - Why not now: Markdown is sufficient for technical version
   - Revisit when: Clients request it
   - Would include: Beautifully formatted PDF of client version

4. **Digital Signature Capture**
   - Why not now: Email approval works for now
   - Revisit when: Need legal enforceability
   - Would include: DocuSign-style signature flow

5. **AI-Powered Photo Analysis**
   - Why not now: Beyond MVP scope
   - Revisit when: v1.0 working smoothly
   - Would include: Client uploads photos, AI assesses quality/suitability

6. **Industry-Specific Templates**
   - Why not now: Website/app split is enough variation
   - Revisit when: Noticing patterns by industry
   - Would include: Restaurant, retail, service business, etc.

7. **Client Follow-Up Automation**
   - Why not now: Manual follow-up is fine for low volume
   - Revisit when: Processing 10+ forms per week
   - Would include: Auto-send reminder emails, schedule calls

8. **Pricing Calculator Integration**
   - Why not now: AI estimates are sufficient
   - Revisit when: Want dynamic pricing
   - Would include: Real-time price updates based on selections

## üö® KEY RISKS & MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| AI generates inaccurate recommendations | Medium | High | Test with 10+ scenarios, refine prompts, add human review step |
| Form too long/complex for clients | Medium | High | User test with 3 non-technical people, time them |
| Conditional logic breaks | Low | Medium | Comprehensive testing of all question paths |
| Email delivery fails | Low | High | Use reliable service (Resend), add retry logic, test thoroughly |
